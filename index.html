                                            Starting fom the scratch I was born in the capital of 
                                            Ethiopia(specifically in Tikur Anbessa Hospital) in
                                            May 22 2000(in Gregorian calander). Then my family 
                                            moved to Hawassa for living. Although I cannot remember
                                            my childhod Hawwasa is my beloved city from my faded 
                                            meomeries. After 6 years we moved back to Addis Ababa.
                                            Then we started living in our current residence
                                            (Asko in Gulele subcity).<br>

                            ( from grade 1 up to grade 6) and Lideta Catholic 
                            Cathedral School( from grade 7 up to grade 8). 
                            I finished secondary school in Lideta Catholic Catedral
                             School. Most of my memories about my life are connected
                             o my school life (specially in LCCS). 
                            As every child in generation I always had diffrent answers
                             when people asked me what I want to be when I grow up. 
                             I didnot get the question untill I was grade 5 student.
                              My answer was to be a Pilot in grade 7. In grade 9
                               I wanted to be a desiner. In grade 12 I wanterd to join
                                the medical school or be an arctect but none of this
                                 assumptions became true.</p><br>

                            of Addis Ababa Institute of Technology. My freshman year
                             had a lot of ups and downs. The first semister was 
                             exciting and easy as I was learning common course of pre 
                             Engineering. Then on second semister I joined Software 
                             Engineering Department.
                             Then my life started getting boring becouse it was always
                              about attending endless classes, doing assignments, studing for 
                             tests and getting surprized by the results.
                              My Second year's first semister was the best time of all
                               becouse it was the time were I knew  I can be A software engineer,
                               how to handle my works and workout on my schedules 
                               and got to know my field more. <br>
                            My hobbies are hiking, listning(anything), swimming,
                             travelig etc...I prefer reading books over sport and
                              watching movies over paying games. They are part of
                              hobbies. And mostly I enjoy thinking about somthing 
                              in a quite and dark place. <br><br></p>
