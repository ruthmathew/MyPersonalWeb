                             May 22 2000(in Gregorian calander). Then my family 
                             moved to Hawassa for living. Although I cannot remember
                              my childhod Hawwasa is my beloved city from my faded 
                              meomeries. After 6 years we moved back to Addis Ababa.
                               Then we started living in our current residence
                               (Asko in Gulele subcity).<br></p></td>

                            Cathedral School( from grade 7 up to grade 8).

                             School. Most of my memories about my life are connected
                             o my school life (specially in LCCS). 
                            As every child in generation I always had diffrent answers
                             when people asked me what I want to be when I grow up. 
                             I didnot get the question untill I was grade 5 student.
                              My answer was to be a Pilot in grade 7. In grade 9
                               I wanted to be a desiner. In grade 12 I wanterd to join
                                the medical school or be an arctect but none of this
                                 assumptions became true.</p><br></td>

                             tests and getting surprized by the results.<br>
                            My hobbies are hiking, listning(anything), swimming,
                             travelig etc...I prefer reading books over sport and
                              watching movies over paying games. They are part of
                              hobbies. And mostly I enjoy thinking about somthing 
                              in a quite and dark place. <br><br></p></td>
